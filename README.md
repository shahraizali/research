## Database Space Saving
Abstract-: A technique to codify the names of people in Databases and Data warehouses to reduce the storage requirements and enhance processing speed is presented. It is estimated that the storage requirement can be reduced, which is normally dominated by the entries of first name, middle name and last name and storage requirements for Data warehouses keep on increasing. The scheme of the Algorithm replaces the first name, middle name and last name in numeric charterers instead of alpha characters for storage. It decodes them into actual Alpha Characters at the time retrieval. The step by step analysis and working of the algorithm is presented.
